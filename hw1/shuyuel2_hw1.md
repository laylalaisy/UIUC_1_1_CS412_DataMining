- Minx:
  - Midterm = 75
  - Final = 77

##### (b) Mean, mode and median:

- Mean:
  - Midterm:  88.7
  - Final: 88.2
- Mode:
  - Midterm: 96
  - Final: 80, 88
- Median:
  - Midterm: 89
  - Final: 88

##### (c) First quartile, third quartile and inter-quartile range:

  - First Quartile:  84
  - Third Quartile: 96
  - Inter-Quartile: 12

- Final:

  ![1537059515656](shuyuel2_hw1.assets/1537059515656.png)

  - - First Quartile:  80
    - Third Quartile: 95
    - Inter-Quartile: 15

##### (d) Variance(sample & population):

- Variance:

$$
Var = E((X-\overline{x})^2) = E(x^2) - [E(x)]^2
$$

- Population:
  $$
  Var = \frac{1}{n}*\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \overline{x})^2
  $$


- Sample:
  $$
  Var = \frac{1}{n-1}*\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \overline{x})^2
  $$


- Midterm: 
  - Population Variance: 58.610
  - Sample Variance: 65.122
- Final:
  - Population Variance: 57.560
  - Sample Variance: 63.956

##### (e) Standard Deviation (sample & population):

- Standard Deviation:
  $$
  Std = \sqrt{Var}
  $$


- Midterm: 
  - Population Standard Deviation: 7.656
  - Sample Standard Deviation: 8.070
- Final:
  - Population Standard Deviation: 7.587
  - Sample Standard Deviation: 7.997
